# Next-Sentence-Prediction-Using-Transformers
This notebook implements next-sentence prediction using Transformer architecture. It preprocesses text data, builds a Transformer-based language model, and predicts the next sentence based on input. The project highlights the effectiveness of attention mechanisms for text understanding and language generation tasks.
